# Ultimate TF2 Visual Fix Pack

A pack of visual fixes for TF2, to be sent to Valve.
Contains models, materials, textures, particles, and source files that can be easily modified and compiled.

Highlights of the pack:
    Some weapons with missing LODs got them and also some jaggy weapons got improved (smoothing)
    Fixed many weapons missing crit glowing
    Fixed cosmetics having the full color bug
    Fixed Dragon's Fury to not be as laggy and blinding, also particle size now correctly is like the hitbox size
    Fixed Pyro flames being completely opaque (now in Pre-JI style), and them just breaking completely sometimes 
    Heavy's miniguns have actually good looking shells now, not the orange squares
    Muzzleflashes been improved, for example, Minigun's is now more like its 2012 better one.
    Fixed Photo Badge and Clan Pride to actually have the default texture the creators intended to be used and doing the promise Valve did 5 years ago.
    Fixed Dragon Fury itself looking bleak, and Thermal Thruster has a better texture now (and synced up particles with the thrusters bursts!)
    Antarctic Eyewear white glasses fix from the creator
    Fixed caps having bad phong parameters (Look much better and actually wearable now)
    Many stock weapons got the good shading parameters which were destroyed in Love and War and Gun Mettle.
    Many non stock weapons also got improved to be closer to the old stock weapons standard and be more consistent
