# Ultimate TF2 Visual Fix Pack

A pack of visual fixes for TF2, to be sent to Valve.
Contains models, materials, textures, particles, and source files that can be easily modified and compiled.

Highlights of the pack:

* Many stock weapons got the good/proper shading parameters which were messed up in the Gun Mettle update.
* Many non stock weapons also got improved to be closer to the old stock weapon style and are more consistent.
* Some weapons with missing LODs and bad smoothing have been fixed.
* Fixed many weapons missing glows when critical hit boosted.
* Fixed Dragon's Fury to not be as laggy and blinding, also particle size now correctly is like the hitbox size and visually improved.
* Fixed Pyro flames being blinding and ugly (now in Pre-JI style), and them just breaking completely sometimes.
* Heavy's miniguns have good looking shells now, not the orange squares.
* Muzzleflashes have been improved, for example Minigun's is similar to the pre-mid2012 one and pistol/revolver's flashes no longer lag behind and are more solid/locked.
* Explosions have been improved, they look slightly better and have less annoying smoke with shorter lifetime and more transparency. Additionally a new Rocket/Sticky Jumper explosion has been made that fits the Jumper theme.
* Fixed Dragon Fury itself looking bland, and Thermal Thruster has a better texture now (and synced up particles with the thrusters bursts!)
* General cosmetic fixes like fixing bad vmt parameters and bad/wrong team texture colors. (E.g. Several Ellis' Cap reskin cosmetics that had bad materials now look much better, Pocket Medic's Heavy version no longer looks bland, Tyurtlenek's blue texture now matches with Heavy's shirt, Lucky Shot now looks consitent with Soldier's actual helmet, Antartic Eyewear's white goggles problem (Fixed by item's creator) and such and similar fixes are included).
* Fixed Photo Badge and Clan Pride to actually have the default texture the creators intended to be used. Valve said they will fix it 5 years ago, but it never happened.
* Fixed some cosmetics sometimes becoming completely neon colored. (Being completely glowing white/yellow/blue)
